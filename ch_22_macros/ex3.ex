# Exercise: MacrosAndCodeEvaluation-3
# The Elixir test framework, ExUnit, uses some clever code-quoting tricks. For example, if you assert

# ​   assert 5 < 4
# you’ll get the error

# ​   Assertion with < failed
# ​   code: 5 < 4
# ​   lhs:  5
# ​   rhs:  4
# The test code parsed the assertion parameter into the left-hand side, the operator, and the right-hand side.

# The Elixir source code is on GitHub (at https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir). The implementation of this is in the file elixir/lib/ex_unit/lib/ex_unit/assertions.ex. Spend some time reading this file, and work out how it implements this trick.

# (Hard) Once you’ve done that, see if you can use the same technique to implement a function that takes an arbitrary arithmetic expression and returns a natural-language version.

# ​   explain do: 2 + 3 * 4
# ​   #=> multiply 3 and 4, then add 2
